# angular-sample1
Following an angular sample app, from https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-create-your-first-angular-app-in-20-min-146201d9b5a7

These are notes for the repo owner (me, Jason!).

Need to install:
1. npm install @angular/cli (or npm install -g @angular/cli)

if you don't install globally then you need to reference relative like:

node node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng

Like this:

node ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve

the app runs on http://localhost:4200/
